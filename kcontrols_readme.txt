- works under Delphi 7 and higher (tested on Delphi 7, DelphiXE+) 
  and Lazarus 1.2.2 and higher
- should work under Delphi 6
- some more problems might be experienced for older Lazarus versions
- see other readme files for additional informations about individual components


INSTALLATION:
-------------------
1. Compile and install package. It might be needed to specify search path to Source directory in Delphi/RAD Studio.
   For Rad Studio XE2 and later add VCL and VCL.Imaging namespaces to Unit Scope Names.
2. When compiling an application or demo, it might be needed to specify the search path to KControls sources 
   or JCL sources (if JCL is configured via kcontrols.inc).

  Please (if possible) keep in mind the differences between Delphi and Lazarus (mainly string encoding UTF16 in Delphi vs. UTF8 in Lazarus).
  When working with texts, always test with different Unicode characters.
  Testing of BiDi features is not required, because they are not supported by KControls.
